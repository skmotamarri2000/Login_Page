The Login page is designed using HTML and CSS. The web page consists of two main items. One is the input field and the Login button. Coming to the input fields, there are two input fields given to the user
to proivde their credentials. One is to enter the username or email and the other is to provide the password. 
Below the input input fields, there is a login button for the users to click to verify or authenticate their details in order to gain access. 
Addition to these, I have provided the forgot password option and register link option for the new users.
